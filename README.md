### 💻 Projects 
#### [Analysing Crime to Guide Resource Allocation](https://github.com/Kaori61/crime-data-analysis)
Capstone project exploring London crime trends using MET Police data.
Python was used for cleaning, EDA, and regression modelling; Tableau was used for interactive dashboards. 
The project identified boroughs with the highest crime rates, the most common crime types, etc., to inform security strategies and resource allocation.

**Tools used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn), Tableau, GitHub
