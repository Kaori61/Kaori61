# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaori! Welcome to my profile 🌻
### 🚀 Aspiring Data & BI Professional | Problem Solver at Heart

I'm transitioning into the world of **data analytics**, driven by a passion for turning data into actionable insights and supporting smarter, evidence-based decisions. With a background in biochemistry and professional experience in fast-paced environments, I bring strong analytical thinking, attention to detail, and a love for solving complex problems.

### 💻 Projects 
- #### [Analysing Crime trends](https://github.com/Kaori61/crime-data-analysis)
Personal capstone project analysing crime trends across London using MET Police data, to uncover insights to support strategic decision-making.
Used **Python** for data cleaning, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **hypothesis testing**, and building a **regression model** to forecast crime trends. Designed interactive **Tableau dashboards** to visualise borough-level patterns, highlight high-crime areas, and identify common crime types.
Insights from the analysis were intended to demonstrate how data could be used to inform resource allocation and public safety strategies.

**Tools used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-learn), Tableau, GitHub

- #### [Car Market Insights: A Price Analysis](https://github.com/Kaori61/Car-Price-Analysis)

Group hackathon project exploring key factors influencing car prices using **Python** and **Tableau**.
Conducted data cleaning, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression modelling** in Jupyter Notebook, and visualised key insights with Tableau dashboards.
The analysis revealed that **engine size** and **brand** were strong price predictors, and that **rear-wheel drive** vehicles were generally priced higher.

**Tools used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Tableau, GitHub
