# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaori! Welcome to my profile 🌻
### 🚀 Aspiring Data & BI Professional | Biochemistry Graduate | Healthcare Professional

I'm transitioning into the world of **data analytics**, driven by a passion for turning data into actionable insights and supporting smarter, evidence-based decisions. With a background in biochemistry and professional experience in fast-paced environments, I bring strong analytical thinking, attention to detail, and a love for solving complex problems.

I'm actively exploring opportunities as a **Data Analyst**, **Business Analyst**, or **Consultant**, where I can continue growing and making an impact through data.
